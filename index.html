Until the very end, Nazi propaganda sought to instill fear by spreading terrifying reports from the German eastern territories occupied by the Soviet Army. These reports were disseminated through newspapers and radio broadcasts to counteract the growing sense of defeatism—the belief that victory was no longer possible. The death register of the city of Wolfenbüttel records multiple suicides by revolver and illuminating gas around April 11, 1945. These suicides occurred because local residents feared the vengeance of the victorious Allied forces, succumbed to despair, or sought to escape the consequences of their personal involvement in the Nazi terror regime.

As it quickly became clear that Nazi propaganda in Wolfenbüttel had been based on lies, the townspeople gradually emerged from their basement hideouts and welcomed the Allied liberators. Many who had remained loyal to the Nazi regime until the arrival of the U.S. Army—some even willing to hand over deserters in Wehrmacht uniforms to the Gestapo until the very last day of Nazi rule—were seen just days later standing along the streets, waving at the American soldiers atop their tanks. One fact remains undeniable: the people of Wolfenbüttel did not liberate themselves from National Socialist rule.

Scattered German soldiers in Wehrmacht uniforms surrendered without resistance to the advancing American GIs, who patrolled the streets with rifles at the ready. They were then transported to one of the many prisoner-of-war camps. Meanwhile, U.S. soldiers distributed chocolate, biscuits, and chewing gum to local children. In a gesture of peace, some adults shared cigarettes with the very soldiers who had been their enemies only the day before.

On April 11, 1945, Elli Bücher also emerged from her hiding place in the Kunsthaus Koch. A Jewish woman in a so-called privileged mixed marriage with the well-known Wolfenbüttel artist Otto Bücher, she had been hidden there by courageous helpers since February 6, 1945. Just weeks earlier, on February 25, 1945, the last documented transport of Jews from Braunschweig to the Theresienstadt concentration camp had taken place.

At least 40 Jewish men and women who had lived in Wolfenbüttel and were deported in 1942 and 1943 fell victim to the Nazi extermination policies.
